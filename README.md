# MLP Project T12025 - Kaggle Competition

## Project Overview

The goal of this competition is to predict a systemâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of the system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by the system's antivirus software.

Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a `MachineID`. The `target` column represents the ground truth, indicating whether malware was detected on the machine.

Using the information and labels in `train.csv`, the objective is to predict the `target` for each machine in the `test.csv`.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated based on the accuracy score, which compares the predicted classes and the true target values in the test set. The goal is to predict whether a system is infected or not using the given system properties.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this Repository** (if applicable).
2. Set up a Kaggle notebook for the competition and name it appropriately.
3. Build and train your machine learning model using the `train.csv` dataset.
4. Generate predictions for the `test.csv` dataset.
5. Save the predictions in a CSV file in the correct format (`id,target`).
6. Submit your notebook and the prediction file on Kaggle.

## Note
